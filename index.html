        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Who is a Tax Consultant?</h3>
            <p>A tax consultant is a financial professional who specializes in developing tailored strategies to help
                individuals and businesses manage their tax obligations efficiently. Their main aim is to minimize tax
                liabilities while strictly adhering to legal frameworks. By understanding your financial goals and
                current situation, a tax consultant designs plans that ensure optimal savings and compliance,
                integrating tax planning into your broader financial objectives.</p>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Common Tax Mistakes and How to Avoid Them</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Delayed Filing:</strong> Filing taxes late can lead to fines and interest charges, along
                    with missed opportunities such as loss carryforwards.</li>
                <li><strong>Incorrect ITR Forms:</strong> Using the wrong income tax return form may trigger notices or
                    delays. It’s important to select the correct form based on your income and status.</li>
                <li><strong>Verification Oversights:</strong> Completing the return verification step is crucial, which
                    often requires OTPs via Aadhaar or net banking to finalize filing.</li>
